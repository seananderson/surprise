# surprise


## Define Black swans and give examples in other contexts

### Definition

### Argentine and super colonies

### Saga antelope

### "a small number of black swans explain almost everything in our world"

## Iconic fisheries examples in Canada

### Northern cod

### Fraser River sockeye salmon

### Great lakes sea lamprey invasion

## Relationship between black swans and related fields

### Black swans: rarity, extreme impact, and retrospective predictability

### figure describing unexpected and impactful evidence

### Venn diagram comparing to regime shifts, extreme climatic events, mass mortality events, and ecological surprises

### could include table here with examples and citations

## It's not just that surprises and black swan events happen, it's about where they happen

### scalable versus non-scalable events

### salmon size versus salmon returns

### population growth versus population mortality

### but this recruitment might be its own thing

## Why should we expect black swans and surprises for fish and fisheries?

### marine ecosystems contain an enormous number of potentially nonlinear interactions

### fisheries include a human element and humans magnify the consequences

### most fish populations are hard to count and they move (we often have a very imprecise and biased view)

### it's easy to place too much confidence in our models (e.g. Deroba et al. ICES J. Mar. Sci.)

### "Ecologists study extraordinarily complex systems, they base their expectations on limited data that are frequently of short duration, and they are, after all, only human." - Doak et al. Ecology 2008

## Why should we expect more surprises going into the future?

### Climate change

### Figure showing press and pulse of climate change that results in more extremes (Harris et al. 2018 Nature Climate Change)

### It is also an increased variance and increase mean plus increased variance equals more extremes in itself (e.g. IPCC 2012)

### The example of global sea ice area in 2016; global sea ice area was over 8 standard deviations from the mean (could include other examples here)

### the warm blob and blob 2.0

## What is the evidence for surprise and black swan events for fish and fisheries?

### Doak et al. 2008 Ecology --- a survey on ecological surprise

- "1. Have you encountered one or more “surprises” in the course of your field studies? We are defining a “surprise” as a substantial [...] change in the abundance of one or more species resulting from a previously unknown or unanticipated process of any kind..." 52/58: yes

- "2. If so, were you able to make a [...] determination of (or at least formulate a compelling hypothesis for) the cause of the surprise?" 46/58: yes

- "This suggests that the factors responsible for surprises are easy to see but seldom anticipated."

### Mass mortality events in Fey et al. 2015 PNAS

- 727 published accounts of mass mortality events

- there are more published mass mortality events for fish than for other taxa

- and they may be increasing in severity through time

- those events have many causes from human perturbation, to thermal stress, two oxygen stress, to biotoxicity, and disease

### evidence for extreme events in Lake ecosystem time-series in Batt et al. Limnol. Oceanogr.

- Aquatic biological variables experience more extremes than chemical, physical, or meteorological variables

### Blacks want events and animal populations paper --- Anderson et al. 2017 PNAS

- events happen regularly across taxa; most often downward

- observed least frequently for fish

- but explain why (highest noise, shortest, model output from models that don't allow for them)

- The hunt for the black swan in many common fisheries time series is unlikely to bare fruit. Instead, we should aim to be robust to surprises.

## Challenges and solutions

### Try to avoid surprise, embed surprise into models, make systems robust to surprise; detect and react quickly to surprise

## Try to avoid surprise

### The point of this paper is not that we should abandon all the work we do to better predict what will happen in ecological systems and for fisheries thereby avoid surprise

### Provide some excellent examples of this especially in the context of climate change on fish populations and fisheries

## Embed surprise into models

### Figure on mixture distributions, heavy tails, and GEV distribution?

### Mixture distributions

- e.g. Ward et al. 2007 CJFAS

- e.g. Chen and Fournier

- e.g. Thorson extreme catch events

### Heavy tails

- e.g. Anderson et al. 2017 PNAS

- e.g. Anderson and Ward 2019 Ecology

### Extreme-value theory

- Describe the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution

- e.g. Batt et al. 2017 Limnol. Oceanogr.

- e.g. Gaines and Denny 1993 Ecology

## Make the system robust to surprise

### Closed-loop simulation

### Rigorous application of precautionary buffers

- e.g. The Precautionary Approach in Canada and the DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework (could be a figure)

- But what about uncertainty about current status and control points? E.g. P cod in BC

### Promote diversification

- e.g. Fishing diversity reduces revenue variability and adding a permit reduces revenue variability and presumably extremes (Anderson et al. 2017b PNAS)

- but licensing costs and other elements of the system can limit or promote diversification

## Detect and react quickly to surprise

### Adaptive management

- Example of bureaucracy limiting the ability to react quickly. E.g. with CSAS in Canada.

### Automated reporting and visualization

- Data dashboards

- Example of our groundfish data synopsis report

- Plot the data, plot the data, plot the data - RAM

- Visualization can surprise you but it doesn't scale. Modelling scales but it can't surprise you. - Paraphrased from Hadley Wickham

- Almost certainly don't have the space but this could be a figure

## Conclusion

### "Individual surprise events are, by definition, very rare, but it is quite possible that surprise itself  [...] is common enough to be an important factor in the daily lives of managers." Hilborn 1987 North Am. J. Fish. Manag.

### Surprises happen; surprises with fish and fisheries happen; surprises with fish and fisheries will probably become more common

### We can integrate black swans and surprise into our models; we can make our fisheries management systems robust to them; we can work to detect and react to them quickly.
