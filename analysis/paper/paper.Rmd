# Challenges and solutions

## Try to avoid surprise

- experiments with trends *and* events? [@jentsch2007]

## Embed surprise into models

[@ward2007]

[@gaines1993]

## Make the management system robust to surprise

## Detect and react quickly to surprise

# Figures

## Probably

1. Venn diagram of related concepts.
1. Press and pulse climate change extremes [@harris2018]?
   Adapt to also have increased variance?
1. Student-t distribution (with and without skew?), mixture distributions, and
   GEV distribution? Each could be associated with a timeseries.

## Other possibilities

1. Predictability of event vs. potential impact figure from presentation?
1. The Precautionary Approach?
1. Could include some diversification figure republished.
1. A figure from @deroba2015?
1. Example from synopsis report of automated reporting? (probably not)

# Tables

## Probably

1. Examples of surprise and extreme events in fish and fisheries? Time, space,
   reaction to management intervention, ...
1. Table summarizing the main challenges and solutions?

## Other possibilities

1. Related concepts, citations, and examples?
1. A table of scalable and non-scalable quantities for fish and fisheries?
