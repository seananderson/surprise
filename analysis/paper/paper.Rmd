# Figures

1. Venn diagram of related concepts.
1. Student-t distribution (with and without skew?), mixture distributions, and 
   GEV distribution? Each could be associated with a timeseries.
1. The Precautionary Approach?
1. Example from synopsis report of automated reporting? (probably not)
1. Could include some diversification figure republished.
1. Press and pulse climate change extremes [@harris2018]?
   Adapt to also have increased variance?
1. A figure from @deroba2015?
1. Predictability of event vs. potential impact figure from presentation?
   

# Tables

1. Related concepts, citations, and examples?
1. Examples of surprise and extreme events in fish and fisheries? Time, space,
   reaction to management intervention, ...
1. Table summarizing the main challenges and solutions?
1. A table of scalable and non-scalable quantities for fish and fisheries?
